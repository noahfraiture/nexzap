You can declare new variable a new variable with `:=` like in `b := 5` and the type will be infered.
You must write a function `AddMax(a int, b int) int` that will add two numbers with a maximum of 255 and return the result. For example :
- `AddMax(3, 5) == 8`
- `AddMax(129, 14) == 143`
- `AddMax(128, 250) == 255`

> ! Do not forget to declare the package with `package main` at the top of the file
